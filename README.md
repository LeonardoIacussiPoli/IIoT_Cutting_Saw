# IIoT Cutting Saw
The general idea of this project is to use a mmachine learning algorithm installed on the STWIN board microprocessor by STMicroelectronics in order to understand when the machine is off, on or when the machine is cutting a wood table. The classification algorithm is based on the accelerometric data coming from the on board three axial accelerometer (ISM330DHCX).


### Calculation of the cutting tool working time â€“ why is it so important?
